##  Build and Start Local Django Application in a Container
In this time I use my django-api application you can choose your own django application.
or you can also clone use this project from  [here](https://github.com/rthway/Djnago-api-project "link")
### 1. Open your project directory.
*In my case I have dajgo project as name tutorial DIR so I use, *
`$ cd tutorial`

### Create a requirements.txt in your project directory.
**For Python3
**`$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt `
**Python2
**`$ pip freeze > requirements.txt `
### 2. Create a new file called Dockerfile in your project directory.
The Dockerfile defines an applicationâ€™s image content via one or more build commands that configure that image. Once built, you can run the image in a container. 
### 3. Add the following content to the Dockerfile.
    # python base image-os
    FROM python:3.8-slim-buster
    # virtual environment 
    ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
    # define work dir 
    WORKDIR /django
    # copy and install dependency
    COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
    RUN pip3 install -r requirements.txt
	

### 4. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml `in your project directory.

Add the following configuration to the file.

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  app:
    build: .
    volumes:
      - .:/django
    ports:
      - 8000:8000
    image: app:django
    container_name: django_container
    command: python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
```
### 5. Create a file called `.dockerignore `in your project directory and skip unnessesary files like virtual env.
Add the following configuration to the file.
```yaml
*/env
```


### 6. Run the `docker-compose build` command from the top level directory for your project to build docker image.

` $ docker-compose build`
### 7. Run the `docker-compose up` command from the top level directory for your project.
`$ docker compose up `
At this point, your Django app should be running at port 8000 on your Docker host.  Go to http://0.0.0.0:8000 on a web browser to see the Django Application.






> Note:
On certain platforms you might need to edit `ALLOWED_HOSTS` inside `settings.py` and add your Docker host name or IP address to the list. For demo purposes, you can set the value to:

```yaml
...
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']
...
```
